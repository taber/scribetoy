# scribetoy

A Hebrew writing practice tool that turns a chaotic block of text into something easy to read and review on any size screen.

## How do I use it?

Copy and paste a text into the input field, and it'll do a few things for you:

- Strip all [niqqud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqqud) (*vowels*) and [cantillation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_cantillation) (*chanting sounds*) from the text, which are their own entire thing and you don't need to be wasting time trying to copy those to get practice writing the letters, *certainly* not the cantillation marks!
- Break the text down into words so you can look at them one by one, and then
- Break each of those words down into the letters so you can read them in order, as letter forms, names, or both, and write them down.

When you're done with a word, you can click or tap it to mark it as finished so you don't lose your place if you get up to refresh your coffee.

## To do ideas:
- Add ability to grab random verse from Sefaria
- Next/Previous buttons for navigating through a verse series?
- Maybe a "read the letters to me" mode?
